# src/pipeline/__init__.py
"""
This file marks the 'pipeline' directory as a Python subpackage of 'src'.
It enables internal pipeline modules to be imported and used across the broader system â€”
including test modules and orchestration scripts.

No runtime logic is needed here unless explicit package-level initialization is required.
